## Features
- Downgrade most applications available on the App Store (you will need to input the link to the app store app).

## How do I downgrade an application?
1. The application you want to downgrade will need to be uninstalled. If you want to keep the app data, offload the app first.
2. Install PancakeStore using your preferred sideloading method.
3. Log in your Apple ID, and click "Send 2FA Code." If you can, try sending a 2FA code before logging in (there should be this in the settings app, but it was removed in iOS 18?).
4. In most cases, you should get a popup. Accept the new login, and copy the verification code into the 2FA field. If you don't get that popup, type six random numbers into the 2FA field. I assume this works because you must've logged into MuffinStoreJailed/PancakeStore at a different time. 
5. Click "log in" and go to the App Store.
6. Find the application you're looking for, click the share button, and copy the link.
7. Go back to PancakeStore and click the clipboard button.
8. Click "Downgrade App" and wait patiently!
